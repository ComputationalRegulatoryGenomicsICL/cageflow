## Introduction

**ComputationalRegulatoryGenomicsICL/customcageq** is a Nextflow pipeline to process CAGE sequencing data from raw reads to the creation of a CAGEexp (CAGEr) object containing called TSSs. The pipeline is specifically designed to be used upstream of CAGEr.

### Input

Either single-end or paired-end raw CAGE reads. Onle one type of reads (either single- or paired-end) can be used in one run of the pipeline.

### Output

A CAGEexp (CAGEr) object with called TSSs, ready for a downstream analysis with CAGEr.

### Steps

1. Merge per-lane FASTQ files with the [`nf-core/cat_fastq`](https://nf-co.re/modules/cat_fastq) module.
2. Report raw read quality with [`FastQC`](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/).
3. Trim adapters with [`TrimGalore`](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore/blob/master/Docs/Trim_Galore_User_Guide.md) and run [`FastQC`](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) on trimmed reads.
4. Download the reference genome FASTA file from UCSC, if not provided locally, using [`BuxyBox wget`](https://boxmatrix.info/wiki/Property:wget) within a custom module [`DOWNLOAD_FASTA`](https://github.com/ComputationalRegulatoryGenomicsICL/customcageq/blob/dev/modules/local/downloadfasta.nf).
5. Build the Bowtie2 index of the reference genome FASTA file with [`bowtie2-build`](https://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/manual.shtml), if the index is not provided locally.
6. Map the trimmed reads onto the Bowtie2 index using [`bowtie2`](https://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/manual.shtml) with options `-b -F 4 -q 20` to filter out unmapped reads and select only uniquelly mapped reads.
7. Sort the obtained BAM files with uniquelly mapped reads using [`samtools sort`](https://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html).
8. Index the sorted BAM files with [`samtools index`](https://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html).
9. Create a CAGEexp object and call TSSs with [`CAGEr`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/CAGEr.html) using a [BSgenome package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BSgenome.html) for the respective genome.

## Usage

:::note
If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how
to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline)
with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.
:::

<!-- TODO nf-core: Describe the minimum required steps to execute the pipeline, e.g. how to prepare samplesheets.
     Explain what rows and columns represent. For instance (please edit as appropriate):

First, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:

`samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2
CONTROL_REP1,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R2_001.fastq.gz
```

Each row represents a fastq file (single-end) or a pair of fastq files (paired end).

-->

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

<!-- TODO nf-core: update the following command to include all required parameters for a minimal example -->

```bash
nextflow run ComputationalRegulatoryGenomicsICL/customcage \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

:::warning
Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those
provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_;
see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#custom-configuration-files).
